# sqliv5-dataset
This dataset consists of a series of SQL injections, valid SQL queries and adversarial example queries generated by [WAF-A-MoLE](https://github.com/AvalZ/WAF-A-MoLE). It's based on [SQLiV3](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/syedsaqlainhussain/sql-injection-dataset) by Syed Saqlain Hussain, available on Kaggle and also made available here. 

The purpose of this expansion is to have a reliable way to increment the robustness of Web Apps, using it for training Web Application Firewalls that rely on Machine Learning for vulnerability detection.
